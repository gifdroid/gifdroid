GIFdroid is a light-weight image-processing approach to automatically replay the video (GIF) based bug reports for Android apps. GIFdroid consists of three phases, each of which play a crucial role in accomplishing this functionality. Given that GIFdroid was designed and built with extension in mind, each of these phases and each of the component elements of these phases can be extended or substituted to further the functionality of the pipeline as a whole. The intent of this design choice is to allow researchers and developers to customize GIFdroid for future projects or development use cases.

### Keyframe Location
TBU

### GUI Mapping


### Execution Trace generation
